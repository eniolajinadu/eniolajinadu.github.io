Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial

when going about the code on w3schools, it is outdated so use this command instead when updating your remote terminal from your local terminal

git remote set-url origin https://username:token@github.com/username/repo.git

the "username:token" can be obtained when you access personal access tokens from your github. (if you use github) from settings. (n.b: use classic, not the fine-grained tokens)
